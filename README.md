💻 C: The Architecture of Truth
Status: Revamped 2025 | Level: Low-Level / Forensic Logic

What is this?
This is my personal lab for C. No textbook jargon. No 80s robot talk. Just raw, system-level logic explained in simple English.

The Core Logic
Memory Sovereignty: Understanding pointers, addresses, and the stack.

Structural Integrity: Using structs and data types to build a fortress.

Control Flow: Mastering the "Ifs" and "Loops" that run the world.

Real Talk Analogies
break: You find the fire track on the playlist, you stop scrolling. Loop over. 🛑

continue: You see a guy in Crocs at the party, you skip him and move to the next person. Keep rollin'. ⏭️

Pointers: It’s not the money; it’s the map to the safe. 📍
