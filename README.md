This repository is my personal playground for all things C programming, I promise, there's no missing pieces. 

You should learn to C these days. So that your boss can give you arrays. And your memories can never leak. And...

When you read the code, remove the comments first, try understanding it without comments then understand it with comments, after you try to code it yourself.

**🌟 What Awaits You? Why C?🌟**

Inside these virtual walls, you'll find a collection of C code and complete notes.

They say C is the language that other languages dream of becoming. 

If you disagree, you should try pronouncing 'Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.' If you can't, well, that just means you agree!"

Topics are labeled by folders: beginner, intermediate, and advanced—but who needs labels? You'll figure it out as you go. Just dive in and embrace the chaos. Let's roll! 🎉

Have a blast!
