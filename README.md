💻 C: The Architecture of Truth
Status: Revamped 2025 | Level: Low-Level / Forensic Logic

What is this?
This is my personal lab for C. No textbook jargon. No 80s robot talk. Just raw, system-level logic explained in simple English.

The Core Logic
Memory Sovereignty: Understanding pointers, addresses, and the stack.

Structural Integrity: Using structs and data types to build a fortress.

Control Flow: Mastering the "Ifs" and "Loops" that run the world.

Real Talk Analogies
break: You find the fire track on the playlist, you stop scrolling. Loop over. 🛑

continue: You see a guy in Crocs at the party, you skip him and move to the next person. Keep rollin'. ⏭️

Pointers: It’s not the money; it’s the map to the safe. 📍

Why this matters
In the "Digital Cage" (2025–2035), understanding the "Machine Logic" is the only way to stay free. If you can’t see the code, you can’t see the cage.

"Master the C, master the silcon."
