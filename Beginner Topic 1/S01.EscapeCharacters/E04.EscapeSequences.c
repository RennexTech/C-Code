     * So, imagine your 'main' function is your entire Friday night plan.
     * You've got your list:
     *
     * 1. Finish that TikTok edit that will get a million views and 50 dollars total earnings...😂😉
     * 2. Order cake...🍰
     * 3. Start watching that new Netflix series...📺
     *
     * `return 0;` is like telling your master(computer Operating system), "I'm done with the task." 📄✅  
     * It means the program finished running successfully — no errors, no drama, just vibes.
     *
     * Once 'return 0;' executes, it's game over, lights out, app closed. Done. Finished.
     * Any lines of code after it are smoke.
