/**

 * 
 * ## Your Code's "Blueprint & Tool Store" 🏗️
 *
 * As an architect, you're about to design and build a whole new house.
 * You're not gonna forge your own hammers, saws, or even make your own nails from scratch, right?
 * Nah, you hit up Janice from the hardware store, where everything's already pre-made,
 * certified-fresh tools from stable, tested and reputable companies.
 *
 * That's exactly what `#include` does for your C program. It's like telling your
 * construction crew (the compiler): "Yo, go fetch these specific blueprints and toolkits
 * we're gonna need to make this house (your program) stand up!"
 * 
 * So, the compiler(which is bundled with these pre-made tools, grabs them ready to use them to construct
 * your program).
 * 
 * These tools include so many things, if you

#include <stdio.h> // This is like telling the crew, "Grab the 'Standard Input/Output' toolkit!"
                   // This toolkit is packed with all the essential gear for your house for intercommunication toolkit.
                   // It lets your program "talk" to the user (like printing messages
                   // on the screen) and "listen" to them (taking keyboard input).
                   // Super basic, but super essential. 
                   // You can see a snippet of its source code in the images. 
                   //These headers aren't magic, they are files on your PC, see the screenshot in this folder.

#include <stdlib.h> // Next, you tell them, "Now, also grab the 'Standard Utility' toolkit!"
                    // This is your general-purpose toolbox. It's got stuff like the
                    // heavy-duty wrenches, the measuring tapes, and the cleanup gear.
                    // It helps your program manage its resources, convert different
                    // materials (data types), and just generally keep things running smooth.
                    // You might not use every single tool in it every time, but it's always
                    // smart to have it on site(in your code).

#include <windows.h> // This is where it gets a bit specific. You tell the crew,
                     // "Oh, and if we're building this house on a Windows lot, grab the
                     // 'Windows-Specific Construction Gear'!" This toolkit has special
                     // tools and techniques that *only* work if your tool/program is being built
                     // for the Windows operating system. Try to use these tools on a Mac
                     // or Linux construction site, and the compiler will scream at you to hell. 
                     //Some gear is just platform-exclusive, you feel me?

// There's so many tools to do the heavy lifting for you, your work is taking the tool, and knowing how to weird it like a sword.
