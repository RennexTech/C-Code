 * --------- FILE 001 😎😎LET'S GO!! ---------
 * 
 * RULE 1: Read Slowly. 
 * RULE 2: I will just add necessary comments, no overwriting stuff.
 * RULE 3: You should find out what some things do, by yourself. 
 * RULE 4: You don't cram a topic, you do Questions. 
 * 
 * SEASONS: Where necessary, I will use seasons and episodes and structure this thing properly. 
 * 
 * I sprinkle in coding wisdom am 23, yeah I learnt about this stuff, coz am used to staying alone most of the time, I think it will be helpful for you to go through the repo, coz you'll find a lot. 
 * 
 * This isn't just a coding tutorial, its Nick's manual to improve your life as you code. 😙
 * 
 * If you want to make C programming simpler, you structure you stuff well, and avoid complicating your code.
 *  
 * ## Your Code's "Blueprint & Tool Store" 🏗️
 *
 * As an architect, you're about to design a whole new house.
 * You're not gonna forge your own hammers, saws, or even make your own nails from scratch, right?
 * 
 * Nope! You call up Janice from the hardware store, where everything's already pre-made,
 * certified tools from reputable companies.
 *
 * That's exactly what `#include` does for your C program. It's like telling your
 * construction crew (the compiler): "Yo, go fetch these specific blueprints and toolkits
 * we're gonna need to make this house (your program)."
 * 
 * So, the compiler(which is bundled with these pre-made tools, grabs them ready to use them to construct
 * your program).
 *

#include <stdio.h> // This is like telling the crew, "Grab the 'Standard Input/Output' toolkit!"
                   // This toolkit is packed with all the intercommunication toolkit.
                   // It lets your program "talk" to the user (like printing messages/taking keyboard input).            
                   //These headers aren't magic, they are files on your PC. Mine are inside -> C:\MinGW\include 

#include <stdlib.h> // Next, you tell them, "Now, also grab the 'Standard Utility' toolkit!" a general purpose toolkit. 
                    // In construction, we're grabbing the box with all the tools, wrenches, measuring tapes etc.
                    // It helps your program manage its resources, datatype conversion tools, and just generally keep things running smooth.
                    // You might not use every single tool in it every time, but it's always smart to have it on site(in your code).

#include <windows.h> // This is where it gets a bit specific. You tell the crew, "Grab the Windows-Specific Construction Gear!" 
                     // This toolkit has special tools and techniques that *only* work on Windows OS's. Some gear is just platform-exclusive. 

// There's so many OTHER tools to do the heavy lifting for you, your work is taking the tool, and knowing how to weild it like a sword.
